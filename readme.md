# sample pipleine Bigram Language Model

Pipeline trains Bigram Language Model using PyTorch. A bigram language model predicts the next character in a text based on the previous character, making it a fundamental concept in natural language processing (NLP). 

## Features

- **Bigram-based prediction:** Learns to predict the next character based on the last one.
- **Customizable hyperparameters:** Easily adjust context length, batch size, learning rate, and more.
- **Text generation:** Generates new text based on learned patterns in the input data.
- **Training on custom text files:** Load any text file to train the model on your preferred dataset.

NOTE: use dockerFile to build image required for pipeline
